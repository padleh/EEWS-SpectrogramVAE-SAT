# EEWS-SpectrogramVAE-SAT
Deep learning-based estimation of acceleration response spectra from seismic waveform data for Earthquake Early Warning Systems (EEWS).

This repository contains the source code for my undergraduate thesis at Universitas Indonesia. The project explores a deep learning-based framework to estimate **acceleration response spectra (SA(T))** from short-time seismic waveform data using spectrogram input. This method aims to support **On-site Earthquake Early Warning Systems (EEWS)** in Indonesia.

## Project Overview

Traditional EEWS frameworks rely on feature extraction and phase-picking to estimate earthquake intensity parameters. This project proposes a faster, end-to-end alternative using **log-Mel spectrogram** inputs and **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** models (CNN-DNN and CNN-LSTM) to reconstruct SA(T) values.

Key highlights:
- Input: 2â€“3s waveform spectrograms from accelerometer data (P-wave window).
- Output: Acceleration response spectra SA(T) for structural response analysis.
- Models: CNN-DNN VAE (more stable) and CNN-LSTM VAE (effective for short periods).
- Evaluation: Performed on both Indonesian (BMKG) and Italian (INSTANCE) datasets.

## Results Summary

- **CNN-DNN VAE (3s)**:
  - RÂ² = 0.9460 on INSTANCE
  - RÂ² = 0.8633 on BMKG
- **CNN-LSTM VAE (short-period T=0.01s on BMKG)**:
  - RÂ² = 0.9749
